        description: "Fanged Wyverns (Japanese: 牙竜種 Garyūshu) are a class of monster first introduced in Monster Hunter Portable 3rd. They are known for being Fanged Beast-like Wyvern monsters that have highly developed limbs. Up until the Fifth Generation, the only known species of these wyverns were Zinogre and its variations. The Fifth Generation introduced many notable Fanged Wyverns, such as Tobi-Kadachi, Odogaron, Magnamalo, and Lunagaron. With the new additions to this classification, the common traits of the Fanged Wyverns have been narrowed to being quadrupedal and having wingless forelimbs larger than their hindlimbs, while other body structures may vary; some like Odogaron and Tobi-Kadachi anchor their weight completely on their limbs pointing downward, while Great Jagras or Dodogama occasionally drag their bodies with limbs spreading to the sides, not unlike Leviathans. A common trait shared among many Fanged Wyverns is their agility and speed; however, several Fanged Wyverns, like the aforementioned Great Jagras and Dodogama, are much less nimble."

Greatly resembling nonfictional theropods, these monsters are well adapted for life on land, using their powerful hindlimbs to get around from place to place rather than using wings or other means to travel.[5] A common trait that most Brute Wyverns share is the small forelimbs that they can barely use, but there are some exceptions that have heavily developed those limbs to use in combat.[6]"

        description: "Bird Wyverns (Japanese: 鳥竜種 Chōryūshu) are a class of monsters introduced in the first generation. They are a small to medium sized class that includes Flying Wyverns with slender bodies that are bipedal and, in some cases, either have wings or lack wings. There are two distinct types of Bird Wyverns: Flying Bird Wyverns and Theropod Bird Wyverns. Flying Bird Wyverns exhibit similar characteristics to True Wyverns, with a bipedal stance along with developed and functional wings. Many of these possess a hard, sharp beak which can be used to peck at attackers, and generally behave in a bird-like manner. Theropod Bird Wyverns are reminiscent of Brute Wyverns: flightless, bipedal creatures with long tails and powerful legs. Unlike Brute Wyverns however, these monsters are generally quite small. Furthermore, Theropod Bird Wyverns almost always live under a social hierarchy, with young individuals, females and beta males led by a strong, dominant alpha male, which can command and control his subjects during combat."

When they're weakened by physical damage, they show internal bleeding by the frothing of the purple bubbles from their mouths. Most of these crustaceans resemble crabs, lobsters or scorpions."

They are often much faster than other larger threats. Fanged Beasts were referred to as 'Primatius' in earlier translations due to almost all of the existing members being similar to real-world primates (such as Rajang), although the translation was changed to 'Pelagus' in Monster Hunter Freedom Unite. More varieties of these monsters were added in MHP3 (such as the bear-like Arzuros), and were titled 'Fanged Beasts' in the Japanese version. The name 'Fanged Beasts' was used from the English version of Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate onwards, and later games have introduced more varieties of these monsters."
